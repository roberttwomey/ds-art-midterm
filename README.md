The first project for Data Science and the Arts is a quantiative cultural analysis addressing a data set of your choosing. The project should be similar in scope to the Manovich Rothko/Mondrian analyses, Music Information Retrieval classification, or other examples I will show in class on Tuesday. You will need to: 

1. identify a cultural data set
2. write code to scrape that data locally to datahub
3. write code to extract meaningful/descriptive features
4. write an analysis notebook that produces analysis results. 

For the project proposal, please clone this repository and write up a description (in the form of an abstract) of your proposed effort for the midterm project. Note: You should replace the entire contents of the following section with the three paragraphs covering the points described below.

## Abstract

Replace this text with three paragraphs clearly describing your concept and approach:

- Paragraph 1: What is the cultural data set that you are analyzing? Why is it interesting? What is your research question? What is your hypothesis about the results?

- Paragraph 2: What are the features (and feature extraction techniques) you propose to ask the question? How does this approach differ from the traditional art historical, musicological, manuel/subjective approach to analyzing your cultural subject? How are you expanding on the techniques we have covered in class? What analyses will you implement?

- Paragraph 3: How will you present your results? (visualizations, sonification, short paper, etc.)

## Data

This section should describe your data and its origins. What is your cultural data source? When was it made? Who created the works? Is it digital native, or is it some kind of scan, recording, photo, etc., of an analog form? 

## Code

This section will link to the various code for your project (stored within this repository). Your code should be executable on datahub, should we choose to replicate your result. This includes code for data acquisition/scraping, cleaning, analysis, and computing results. Link your notebooks/.py files within this section, and provide a brief explanation of what the code does. Reading this section we should have a sense of how to run your code.

## Results

This section will contain links to documentation of your work in an appropriate format to convey your results. This can include both embedded images of figures you have produced, short summary text, and links to files (with brief descriptions) including:
- image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
- audio files (`.wav`, `.mp3`)
- written text as `.pdf`

## Team Roles

Provide an account of individual members and their efforts/contributions to the specific tasks you accomplished.

## Technical Notes and Dependencies

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Additional libraries you are using for this project
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does this code need to run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
