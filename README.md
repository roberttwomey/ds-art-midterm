## Abstract Proposal

FIRST STEP: Write up a description (in the form of an abstract) of what you will revisit for your final project. This should be three paragraphs clearly describing your concept and approach. What are your desired creative goals? How are you expanding on something we covered in the class? How will you present your work next Wednesday in the final project presentations? 

Paragraph 1: What is the cultural data that you are analyzing, what is your research question, and what is your hypothesis about the results.

Paragraph 2: What are the features (and feature extraction techniques) you propose to ask the question. 

Paragraph 3: What form will your output take? (visualizations, sonification, etc.)

## Team Roles

Accounting for team member efforts and contributions in terms of specific tasks you accomplished for this work. 

## Code


## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- What you include here will very much depend on the format of your final project
  - image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
  - 3d models
  - movie files (uploaded to youtube or vimeo due to github file size limits)
  - audio files
  - ... some other form

## Technical Notes and Dependencies

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Additional libraries you are using for this project
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
