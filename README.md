## Abstract Proposal

Write up a description (in the form of an abstract) of your proposed effort for the midterm project. This should be three paragraphs clearly describing your concept and approach. What are your desired analytic goals? How are you expanding on something we covered in the class? How will you present your results as a visualization, sonification, website, etc?

Paragraph 1: What is the cultural data that you are analyzing, what is your research question, and what is your hypothesis about the results.

Paragraph 2: What are the features (and feature extraction techniques) you propose to ask the question. 

Paragraph 3: How will you present your results? (visualizations, sonification, short paper, etc.)

## Team Roles

Provide an account of individual members and their efforts/contributions to the specific tasks you accomplished.

## Code

Your code should be executable on datahub, should we choose to replicate your result. This includes data acquisition/scraping, analysis, and computiung results. Link to your notebooks/.py files in this section, and provide a brief explanation of what the code does.

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
- report as `.pdf`

## Technical Notes and Dependencies

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Additional libraries you are using for this project
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
