# Project Title

DSC160 Data Science and the Arts - Midterm Project Repository - Spring 2020

Project Team Members: 
- Firstname Lastname1, name1@ucsd.edu

## Abstract

For the project proposal, you should replace the entire contents of this section with the three paragraphs covering the points described below:

- Paragraph 1: What is the cultural data set that you are analyzing? Why is it interesting? Where will you obtain it from? 

- Paragraph 2: What is your research question? What is your hypothesis about the results? How will you present your results? (visualizations, sonification, short paper, etc.)

- Paragraph 3: What are the features you propose to ask the question? What feature extraction techniques will you use to extract these features? (include links in reference section below) How does your computational approach differ from the traditional art historical, musicological, manuel/subjective approach to analyzing your cultural subject? How are you expanding on the techniques we have covered in class?

## Data

In the final submission, this section should describe your data and its origins with links to the source, and necessary background material:
- What is your cultural data source? 
- When was it made? 
- Who created the works? 
- Is it digital native, or is it some kind of scan, recording, photo, etc., of an analog form? 

## Code

In the final submission, this section will link to the various code for your project (stored within this repository). Your code should be executable on datahub, should we choose to replicate your result. This includes code for data acquisition/scraping, cleaning, analysis, and computing results. Link your notebooks/.py files within this section, and provide a brief explanation of what the code does. Reading this section we should have a sense of how to run your code.

## Results

In the final submission, this section will contain links to documentation of your work in an appropriate format to convey your results. This can include both embedded images of figures you have produced, short summary text, and links to files with brief descriptions, appropriate to your domain of analysis, including:
- image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
- audio files (`.wav`, `.mp3`)
- written text as `.pdf`

## Team Roles

Provide an account of individual members and their efforts/contributions to the specific tasks you accomplished.

## Technical Notes and Dependencies

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Additional libraries you are using for this project
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does this code need to run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)

## Reference

References to any papers, techniques, repositories you used:
- Papers
- Repositories
- Blog posts
